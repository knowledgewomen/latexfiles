\begin{abstract}
Since ancient times, women have been held at an esteemed position in terms of knowledge. This paper tries to address the role of women who have raised the scientific levels to great heights both from the Western and Indian Perspective. From the western viewpoint,  there has been evidences of Greeks and Romans worshipping Goddess Athena and Minerva, respectively. On a similar note, Indians have regarded Goddess Saraswati as the mother of knowledge and wisdom. The intellectual calibre of Indian women has been explicitly stated in the epics and puranas. For example, there is a mention in Mahabharata indicating the managerial capabilities of Draupadi. These characters, albeit mythological portray the essence of the limitless capabilities of women.

Starting from the historic times, the western world has seen women professionals. Some of them are Merit-Ptah the first known physician from Ancient Egypt, Agamede the first female healer from Greece, Hypatia first known woman mathematician, Charlotta Frolich first female historian,  Marie Curie first woman to win a nobel prize, Laura Bassi first woman to earn a university chair (18th century),  Ada Lovelace first woman programmer, Grace Hopper woman who invented first compiler and Mary Anning Paleontologist.

A few remarkable Indians are Avvaiyar, who was one of the greatest poets of all times,  Gargi and Maithreyi, who are mentioned in the Upanishad texts,  the saint poet Mirabhai, Leelavathi, the mathematician and astrologer, Razia Sultana a monarch, the south asian physicians Kadambini Ganguly and Anandhi Gopal Joshi, the meteorologist Anna Manni, Sarla Takral who was the first woman to fly an aircraft and in the present scenario Dr. Shantha, who is heading the Adayar Cancer Institute. 

This paper explores the effort and dedication put forth by the aforementioned personalities with a hope that it will create an inspiration to the present generation female individuals

\section{Introduction}
\section{Case-Studies}

\subsection{Historical Period}
In Vedic period, three Goddesses namely, Illa, Saraswati and Mahi has been quoted for the purpose of acquiring knowledge as \cite{saras}: 

“May Bharati come speeding to our sacrifice and Ila hither awakening our consciousness in human wise, and Saraswati, — three goddesses sit on this blissful seat, doing well the
Work.” 
The image of Goddess (Figure 1) portrays a musical instrument called Veena holding in  two hands, a book in one hand and a tiny garland in another hand. These represent music, knowledge and inner bliss, respectively.

\end{center}

The Vedic period has seen intellectuals like Gargi and Maithreyi. Gargi Vachnaknavi, who lived during 700 BC was honored as a great philosopher \cite{Gargi}. The debate between Gargi and Yajnavalkya has been specified in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, in which Gargi puts forth a series of thought provoking questions to Yajnavalkya. A few such questions from this debate is given below. \\


\textit{Yajnavalkya ,`` said she, ``if all this is pervaded by water, by  what, pray, is water pervaded?''} \\
\textit{``By air, O Gargi.", replied Yajnavalkya.} \\
\textit{``By what, pray, is air pervaded?" }\\
\textit{``By the sky, O Gargi."} \\
\textit{``By what is the sky pervaded?"}  \\

These questions clearly indicate scientific thought process of Indian Women. 

On a similar front, in the Indian Epic Mahabharatha, there are instances of women empowerment. Draupadi is known to have managed the people and wealth in the palace \cite{mahabharatha}. 

In South India, around First or Second Century A.D. there was a Tamil Poet called Avvaiyaar. She can be considered as one of the pioneers in Science also, because she specifies about the information of energy of atom in one of her poems as: \\
\begin{center}
``aNuvaith thuLaiththu Ez kadalai puguththi'' \\
\textit{Energy of seven seas within a pierced atom}\\
\end{center}
\newblock
According to the Greek Mythology, Athena is the embodiment of wisdom and power.\\
Various poems written for her by Odysseus G. Osborne spot light the depth of powers that the Goddess has.\\

\end{center}

One of the many poems written on Athena in relation to Wisdom as \cite{athena}:\\


\textit{Marshal of Wisdom}\\
\textit{give the gift as you resolve,}\\
\textit{As a Lance of Glory,}\\
\textit{Heralding your puissant strike!}\\
\textit{Or like a silent owl}\\
\textit{A glide on the Nights wind}\\
\textit{With talons wide!}\\
\textit{Mighty Athena! Let me be re-born of your thunderbolt!}\\

\newblock
Minerva was the Roman Goddess of Wisdom and war. She is believed to be the inventor of numbers and musical instruments. She was later equated with the Greek Goddess of Wisdom, Athena.

She was called as the “goddess of thousand works” by Ovid, a Roman poet. She was being worshipped on the Capitoline Hill along with Jupiter and Juno as the Powerful triad of Gods.

\subsection{Medieval Period}
\textbf{Lilavati} was the daughter of Bhaskara (during 1150 A.D), who was one of the pioneers in Indian mathematics. The tale goes like this: Lilavati was an intelligent and inquisitive child and Bhaskara had always kept an eye on this nature of hers. However, when Bhaskara analysed her horroscope, he was shocked to see that her marriage will be short-lived. To circumvent this issue, Bhaskara prepared a perfect device that could calculate the auspicious time for her marriage. Lilavati's curiousness drew her close to the device (when her father was not near) and while examining, the pearl that she was wearing fell into the device. The calculations went awry and the auspicious time was missed. Eventually, Lilavati got married, but as feared it was short-lived. Soon after this incidence, Lilavati was extremely upset and was not able to lead her regular normal activities. In order to remove her worries, Bhaskara posed a lot of arithmeic puzzles which made her busy. These questions later on helped her to be the 
greatest mathematicians of all times \cite{lilavati}.

Merit-Ptah is believed by Egytologists to be the first-ever named Physician. She is most notable for being the first woman known by name in the history of the field of medicine, and also the first named woman in all of science as well.\\

She practiced medicine nearly 5,000 years ago, and was immortalized by her son on her tomb as “the chief physician”\cite{merit}.

Janaki Ammal Edavaleth Kakkat (4 November 1897 – 7 February 1984) was the botanist whose works are considered to be one of the most important breakthroughs in the research of sugarcane and eggplant. Having born and brought up in Kerala, she pursued school and college education in her home town and Chennai, respectively. She then went to USA to receive the doctorate during 1931. She is considered to be the first woman to obtain a Ph.D in botany from USA. A flower has also been named after her as 'Magnolia Kobus Janaki Ammal' \cite{janaki}.

Aseema Chatterjee (1917 - 2006) was a notable Indian chemist in the area of organic chemistry and phytomedicine. She received M.Sc in the field of Organic Chemistry in 1938 and D.Sc. from the same university in 1944. ``She made significant contributions in the field of medicinal chemistry with special reference to alkaloids, coumarins and terpenoids, analytical chemistry, and mechanistic organic chemistry''.  \cite{chaterjee}


\newblock
Anandi Gopal Joshi (1865 - 1887) was the first female to obtain the medicine degree from USA. It was during the time of when Britain ruled India and hence Indians had an awareness of science from the west. As a regular practice those days, children were married at an early age and Anandi was not an exception. Her Husband Gopal Joshi encouraged Anandi to pursue education. She gave birth to a boy while she was fourteen years. But due to the non-availability of medical facilities, the baby could not survive beyond 10 days. This prompted her to pursue medicine and her husband helped her to send to USA for a medical profession. Despite her challenges of poor health, she successfully completed MD in 1886. She returned back to India on 1887 and wanted to open a medical college for women in India. But her health declined and died in 1887  \cite{joshi}.

\newblock
Shakuntala Devi (1929 - 2013) was the arithmetic prodigy of the century. She is known as the ``human computer'', since she could calculate even a 13X13 digit multiplication in 28 seconds. Her father was a working in a circus and had taught her card tricks, which enabled him to discovered the mathematical trait in her. She did not have a formal school education because of financial constraints. However, it does not deter the spirit of Shakuntala Devi to pursue the love for numbers. She travelled across widely to Europe and USA and exhibited her talent. Her calculation approach was appreciated by the scholars worldwide and her multiplication of 13X13 number was recorded in Guiness Book of Records. \cite{shakuntala}. 

\newblock
Anna Mani (1918 - 2001) was a physicist and a meterologist, who made important contributions in meterological instrumentation. She was influenced in her younger days by Gandhian movement and vowed to wear kh\={a}di, a typical variety of cloth made by Indians. She initially wanted to pursue medicine, but shifted her career to physics since it appealed her more. She pursued her degree from Presidency college and did research under Sir.C.V. Raman. Since she did not have masters degree, she could not get Ph.D at that time. She then proceeded to Imperial college, London for a degree in meterological studies and then returned back to India. She was the deputy director of Indian Meterological department and authored a number of papers in the area of meterological instrumentation. \cite{anna}
